- The idea of multisets (finite lists up to permutations) 
-- so we need lists as inductive type
-- and we need quotients (also as inductive type)
- operations on multisets (sums and products getting inherited form lists?)
- finite sets as multisets 
- operations on finite sets 
- prove every finite set is a set. 
-- finite in which sense? cardinal finite, Kuratowski finite, etc 
-- exotic examples of finiteness 
- loads of exampels
